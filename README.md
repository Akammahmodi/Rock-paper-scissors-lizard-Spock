My feedback

Here my comments about this exercise:

I understand what 'let' and 'const' are for.<br>
Calling a function=>I need more explaination!<br>
Why we use [] and not () in line 13? Difference!<br>
In line 27=> playerScore++ => Why we use ++??<br>
innerHTML=> I need more explaination!<br>
Line 37 => $ ???<br>
I need to learn more about "Switch and Break"<br>
