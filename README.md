My feedback

Here my comments about this exercise:

I understand what 'let' and 'const' are for.
Calling a function=>I need more explaination!
Why we use [] and not () in line 13? Difference!
In line 27=> playerScore++ => Why we use ++??
innerHTML=> I need more explaination!
Line 37 => $ ???
I need to learn more about "Switch and Break"
